drosera: A Botanical Alternative to the iris Dataset
================
Roman M. Link

## Description

`drosera` is a data package that provides a botanical replacement
dataset for Anderson and Fisher’s famous `iris` dataset that is free
from its troublesome past. It is based on a set of plants that I am
growing on my windowsill which I measured with a caliper in a matter of
a couple of hours to have an example dataset for the
[`corrmorant`](https://github.com/r-link/corrmorant) package and is
entirely devoid of scientific rigor. However, I believe it is a useful
example dataset that will hopefully enable some people to replace `iris`
in their code and package documentation, and maybe even spark an
interest in carnivorous plants in a couple of R users.

It is published under a [Creative Commons Zero
license](https://github.com/r-link/drosera/blob/master/LICENSE), so it
is free to use in any kind of commercial or non-commercial setting. It
would be kind if you add a link to this Github page in case you decide
to use it, but I won’t be mad if you don’t.
